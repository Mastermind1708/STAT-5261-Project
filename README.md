# Time Series Forecasting and Portfolio Optimization Project

This repository contains the final project for STAT 5261 - Spring 2024, which focuses on time series forecasting and portfolio optimization of seven leading technology stocks. The project demonstrates advanced econometric methods and systematic approaches to enhance predictive accuracy and risk management in financial investments.

## Project Overview

The primary objective of the project was to develop a new approach to constructing and optimizing investment portfolios and to test its plausibility by implementing time series modeling and risk management. By applying these techniques, we aimed to enhance the predictive accuracy and risk management strategies for an investment portfolio comprising the leading seven technology stocks.

## Key Features

- **Data Collection**: Utilizes `yfinance` to fetch historical stock data.
- **Data Analysis**: Employs `pandas` and `numpy` for data manipulation and statistical analysis.
- **Visualization**: Creates informative plots to visualize stock trends and correlations.
- **Statistical Models**: Implements models like VAR (Vector Autoregression) to analyze time series data.

## Skills Demonstrated

- **Python Programming**: Writing efficient and clean code for data manipulation and analysis.
- **Data Science**: Applying statistical methods to derive insights from data.
- **Financial Analysis**: Understanding stock market data and interpreting financial metrics.
- **Visualization**: Using libraries like `matplotlib` to create compelling visualizations.
