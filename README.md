# Time Series Forecasting and Portfolio Optimization Project

Welcome to my Stock Analysis project! This repository showcases my ability to analyze financial data using Python, demonstrating skills in data science, statistical analysis, and data visualization.

## Project Overview

The primary objective of the project was to develop a new approach to constructing and optimizing investment portfolios and to test its plausibility by implementing time series modeling and risk management. By applying these techniques, we aimed to enhance the predictive accuracy and risk management strategies for an investment portfolio comprising the leading seven technology stocks.

## Key Features

- **Data Collection**: Utilizes `yfinance` to fetch historical stock data.
- **Data Analysis**: Employs `pandas` and `numpy` for data manipulation and statistical analysis.
- **Visualization**: Creates informative plots to visualize stock trends and correlations.
- **Statistical Models**: Implements models like VAR (Vector Autoregression) to analyze time series data.

## Skills Demonstrated

- **Python Programming**: Writing efficient and clean code for data manipulation and analysis.
- **Data Science**: Applying statistical methods to derive insights from data.
- **Financial Analysis**: Understanding stock market data and interpreting financial metrics.
- **Visualization**: Using libraries like `matplotlib` to create compelling visualizations.
